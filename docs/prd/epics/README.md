## Templates & Guidelines

### SDK Impact Assessment (Required for Every Epic)

Every epic MUST include an SDK Impact Assessment section near the top:

```markdown
## SDK Impact Assessment

| Feature/Endpoint | Needs SDK? | Module | Priority | Notes |
|------------------|------------|--------|----------|-------|
| `POST /v1/foo` | ✅ Yes | `payos.foo` | P0 | New module needed |
| `GET /v1/bar/:id` | ✅ Yes | `payos.bar` | P1 | Add to existing |
| Internal refactor | ❌ No | - | - | No API changes |
| Admin-only endpoint | ❌ No | - | - | Not for partners |

**SDK Stories Required:** 
- [ ] Story 36.X: Add `foo` module to @sly/sdk
- [ ] Story 36.Y: Update MCP server with `payos_foo` tool
```

### Definition of Done (DoD)

Every story must meet these criteria before completion:

- [ ] Code reviewed and merged
- [ ] Tests passing (unit + integration where applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated (if user-facing)
- [ ] **SDK GATE:**
  - [ ] SDK exposure decision documented in story
  - [ ] If SDK exposure needed: Story created/updated in Epic 36
  - [ ] If SDK exposure NOT needed: Reason documented
